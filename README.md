# React Photo Search Application

This project allows you to display pictures for 3 pre-set options ("sunsets", "ocean", and "dolphins"), as well as to search for photos of any desired keyword. To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies, and `npm start` to start it.
